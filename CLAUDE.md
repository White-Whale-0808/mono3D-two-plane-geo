# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Monocular road pitch angle estimation using two-plane geometry. The pipeline processes single camera images through 5 sequential stages to estimate the road's pitch angle in degrees.

## Setup

```bash
# Requires Python 3.12, uses uv as package manager
cp .env.example .env        # Machine-specific paths (CARLA wheel, OpenCV dirs)
uv sync                     # Install dependencies
python scripts/setup_elsed.py  # Build local patched pyelsed (ELSED C++ extension)
```

PIDNet weights must be placed in `pidnet_pretrained_model/PIDNet_L_Cityscapes_test.pt`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Single image inference with visualization
python -m utils.inference_road_lane_segmentation

# Batch inference (CSV in/out; also writes outputs/profile_mae_<dataset>.png and
# outputs/route_profile_<dataset>.png — the whole-route terrain profile)
python -m utils.batch_inference_road_lane_segmentation

# CARLA real-time test (requires running CARLA server)
python carla_module/realtime_test.py [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--map MAP]

# Same as the single-image command above — main.py is a thin wrapper around it
python main.py
```

All inference config lives in `config/inference_road_lane_segmentation.yaml`.

## Pipeline Architecture

Entry point: `libs/inference/pipeline.py::infer_one()`

```
road_segmentation → line_segmentation → lane_segmentation → lane_fitting → pitch_estimation
```

| Stage | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| road_segmentation | `libs/inference/road_segmentation.py` | PIDNet-L semantic segmentation → binary road mask |
| line_segmentation | `libs/inference/line_segmentation.py` | ELSED line detection with adaptive length threshold (perspective-aware) |
| lane_segmentation | `libs/inference/lane_segmentation.py` | Near-to-far continuity tracking: seed innermost lanes at bottom, track upward band-by-band by predicted-x association. Thresholds (association tolerance, seed window, slope gates, model memory) are **derived from projection geometry** — camera intrinsics + height are required |
| lane_fitting | `libs/inference/lane_fitting.py` | Inner-chain extraction (`inner_chain_points`: shadowing → dense per-row inner envelope → fragments split at gaps / x-jumps → junction-consistency purge keeping the largest fragment group) → sub-pixel edge refinement on the **unmasked** image (`refine_inner_points`: nearest qualifying gradient peak ±3 px, parabola sub-pixel) → continuous gap-bridged lane curve per side (`lane_curve`) |
| pitch_estimation | `libs/inference/pitch_estimation.py` | `estimate_pitch_from_curves`: sample lane widths from the two curves (z-uniform), inverse perspective → depth, then continuous pitch(z) via local z-window Theil-Sen slopes (`method: windowed`, default — window ±max(1 m, 0.15·z) is the explicit spatial resolution) or the global weighted spline (`method: spline`) |

The pipeline also runs the WWH-15 evidence guards:

- `libs/inference/paint_evidence.py` — photometric "is this actually paint?"
  checks (a marking is a bright ridge of bounded width). `filter_paint_segments`
  drops non-paint ELSED segments before tracking (kills shadow boundaries so the
  tracker re-seeds on the true line); `truncate_at_evidence_break` cuts the
  refined inner chain at the first sustained failure (crest-occlusion tails).
  Thresholds are module constants with derivations in the docstring, not config.
- `lane_fitting.truncate_at_depth_jump` — depth-continuity guard on paired-row
  z: a jump exceeding both the continuity gate and 1.5× the local-plane
  extrapolation marks a hidden interval (real paint beyond a crest is a
  DISCONNECTED section and is never joined to the near chain).

`lane_segmentation.py` is a single unified tracker (the older slope-dependent
`_positive_angle.py` / `_negative_angle.py` variants have been removed).
`f_x`, `f_y`, `w_real` and `camera_height` are **required** — every threshold
is computed from the pinhole model (see the module docstring). The hand-tuned
fallback for un-calibrated cameras (`min_slope` / `lane_band_tolerance` /
`roi_near` / `roi_far`) was removed 2026-08-27: no caller ever reached it.

## Critical Conventions

- **`setup_env()` must be called before any C extension imports** (cv2, pyelsed, carla). See `utils/env_setup.py`.
- **Image format**: Pipeline expects RGB throughout. Use `cv2.cvtColor` to BGR only for `cv2.imwrite()`.
- **Coordinate system**: OpenCV convention (origin top-left, y-down). Left lane has negative slope, right lane positive.
- **`resize_size` in config is `[height, width]`**, but PIL expects `(width, height)` — the swap is handled in `predict_road()`.
- **CARLA overrides `f_y = f_x`** (square pixels) in `carla_module/realtime_test.py::load_config()`.

## Config Structure (YAML)

Config sections map 1:1 to pipeline stages:
- `road_segmentation` — (currently empty, PIDNet uses argmax not threshold)
- `line_segmentation` — `min_segment_length_near`, `min_segment_length_far`
- `lane_segmentation` — `track_bands` only (continuity-tracking band count, clamped to >= 16 internally; independent of `lane_fitting.num_bands`). All other thresholds are derived from `pitch_estimation`'s calibration
- `lane_fitting` — `samples_per_meter` (geometry mode: z-uniform width-sample density in pitch_estimation, per meter of visible depth), `num_samples` (width-sample fallback when `samples_per_meter` is unset). `inner_chain_points` itself has no density tunables: shadowing + dense per-row inner envelope + fragment/junction purge, every kept row becomes a point — `lane_curve` (continuous gap-bridged polyline per side) is the model and pitch_estimation resamples it. `w_real` is inner-edge-to-inner-edge, so widths are measured on inner edges. **It is road-specific**: 3.25 comes from this dataset's double-yellow-left / single-white-right layout on a 3.5 m lane; a different marking combination re-derives it (see the config comment). Width sampling and pitch live in pitch_estimation (`sample_widths_from_curves` / `estimate_pitch_from_curves`)
- `pitch_estimation` — `f_x`, `f_y`, `w_real`, `camera_height`, `camera_forward_offset` (`camera_height` feeds the lane_segmentation geometry; CARLA overrides `f_y=f_x` and `camera_height=2.4`), `method` (`windowed` default = local z-window Theil-Sen, no global residual filter; `spline` = global weighted UnivariateSpline with Theil-Sen MAD prefilter), `nearfield_w_real` (**default false**; per-frame near-field self-calibration of `w_real` from the ground-plane camera-height anchor at z 2–5 m, θ0-gated with bounded hold — `NearfieldWidthCalibrator`; the configured `w_real` becomes the fallback and stages 1–4 still use it for threshold derivation. Lane width really does vary per road: GT-projected truth is 3.29/3.55/3.31–3.39 on full_road and 3.34 vs 3.25 on the two hill routes, and the near-field estimate matches it to 8 mm where the gate opens. Off by default because a sustained grade tilts the body ±0.12° relative to the road, which pushes θ0 to the gate edge and sends 80–95 % of those frames to the fallback — see the config comment for the per-route numbers and the θ0-correction next step)
- `ground_truth` — **not a pipeline stage**: this is the reference the runners score against. `height_source` picks which column of `road_profile.csv` supplies the profile height — `auto` (default: `z_mesh` when present, else `z`), `analytic` (`z`, the OpenDRIVE centreline) or `mesh` (`z_mesh`, the downward ray-cast). Asking for `mesh` on a pre-WWH-14 dataset raises; only `auto` falls back. The collector's road surface deviates from the analytic centreline in a few localised sections and the camera sees it, so `mesh` is the better reference — see the module docstring in `libs/road_profile_gt.py` for the evidence, and **do not re-litigate it with absolute-height MAE**, which is dominated by a per-frame constant offset.
