    """Clean inner-lane-line points for one side, from tracked segments.

    w_real (3.216 m) is the INNER-edge-to-inner-edge lane width, but the lane
    tracker deliberately keeps the whole marking group (all parallel paint
    edges — evidence for tracking). This function recovers the measurement
    semantics downstream:

    1. Per-row inner envelope (no tunable): for every image row y covered by
       at least one segment, x_inner(y) = innermost x among the covering
       segments (max x on the left side, min x on the right). Rows with no
       coverage stay gaps — nothing is fabricated, and density is NOT shaped
       here: the lane curve is a continuous model and pitch_estimation
       resamples widths z-uniformly on its own.
    2. Fragments: the envelope splits at coverage gaps and at 1-row x steps
       beyond _FRAG_MAX_STEP_PX (envelope switched segments).
    3. Junction consistency: a bridge between adjacent fragments whose
       direction deviates from both fragments' own end directions by more
       than _JUNCTION_TOL_PX (scaled by the gap dy) marks a break; the
       largest consistent fragment group (by row count) survives. One rule
       drops both mid-chain off-lane runs (artifact next to a dashed gap,
       frames 145-156) and bottom outer-edge fallback rows (inner segment
       ending above the image bottom, 27-93 px outward).

    inner_chain_points is limited by ELSED's straight-segment approximation

    gradient profile around the prior x, take the strongest gradient of the
    expected sign (inner edge of the LEFT marking is bright→dark going right,
    of the RIGHT marking dark→bright), and localize it to sub-pixel with a
    parabola fit over the peak's 3 gradient samples.

    Uses the unmasked image — the road mask boundary creates fake gradients
