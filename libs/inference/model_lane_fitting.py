Lane fitting for a learned 2D lane detector front end (WWH-25).

The detector (CLRNet, lane_detector.py) returns whole lane-line instances —
through dashed gaps and unpainted road — at ~72 points each. This module turns
the two ego lines into the per-row curves the metric stage consumes, keeping
what the image can verify apart from what the model inferred:

    pick_ego        the ego pair, chosen as NEAR the vehicle as possible
    guard_ego       reject a pair whose near-field width is not a lane width
    densify         the detector polyline at every integer image row
    refine_center   per row: find the painted stripe's CENTRE when the image
                    shows one (src = paint), else src = model. The pipeline
                    uses it for the FLAG only by default — snapping the
                    position made pitch worse (pipeline_clrnet `refine`)
    apply_tail      optionally drop model-only rows beyond the farthest paint
    model_curve     {"y", "x", "src"} — lane_fitting.lane_curve's format plus
                    the source flag, so the existing metric stage reads it as is
    trim_pitch_to_depth  no pitch beyond a depth the weights are trusted to

Why the CENTRE and not the inner edge the ELSED front end measures: the
detector is trained on centre-line labels, so its rows (src = model) are
centres. Refining paint rows to the inner edge would make the reference
point jump by half a stripe at every paint/model switch — a width step along
depth, which the two-plane stage reads as grade (WWH-25 §3). With both on the
centre the near-field width is centre-to-centre, which is also what OpenLane's
lane_width_gt measures.

Nothing here reads the lane width; the only geometry is the row depth
f_y*h/(y-cy) (with paint_evidence's grade margin), as in paint_evidence.
