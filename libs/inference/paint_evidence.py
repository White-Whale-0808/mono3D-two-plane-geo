Paint-evidence photometric checks (WWH-15).

Both downhill failure modes are the tracker following an edge that is NOT a
painted lane marking (crest: kerb / retaining wall / disconnected far road;
sag bottom: shadow boundary lying on the road). Every geometric detector
tried against them failed for the same reason: the quantities it tested were
themselves computed from the contaminated chain. These checks instead ask
the IMAGE whether each tracked location actually looks like paint — a signal
the failure cannot pollute.

A painted marking is a bright RIDGE of bounded width: intensity rises
immediately at the edge, stays high across the stripe (_STRIPE_M = 0.125 m
in CARLA), then falls back to road level (for a double marking, into the
gap between stripes).
Per probe location (x, y) on a 3-row-averaged horizontal profile I:

    peak      = max I[x + dir·(1.._PEAK_PX)]        bright side of the edge
    base_opp  = median I[x − dir·(2..7)]            road on the other side
    base_far  = min I[x + dir·(lo..hi)]             beyond the whole stripe
    ridge     = min(peak − base_opp, peak − base_far)

with [lo, hi] = [k+2, 3k+8] px and k = f_x·_STRIPE_M/z_min(y) the stripe-width
upper bound from projection geometry (z_min carries the ±15° grade margin,
see _Geometry). Real paint scores ~25+ gray levels; a shadow boundary fails
(one side all dark, the other a plateau that never drops), and so do kerbs
and walls (insufficient contrast against the road).

The peak window is deliberately FIXED at 1.._PEAK_PX: the probe sits on the
edge, so the bright side starts immediately regardless of stripe width.
Widening it with the geometric stripe bound was tried and broke the check
near the horizon, where the grade margin inflates k to ~23 px and the
window swallows bright far-field surfaces (down_hile frame 157).

Two layers use this score (validated on all three Town03 datasets):

1. filter_paint_segments — drops non-paint ELSED segments BEFORE lane
   tracking, direction-agnostic (a segment may be either edge of any
   stripe). With the shadow boundary gone the tracker re-seeds on the true
   white line: mode B frames recover full visible range instead of losing
   data (down_hile 438-450: MAE 1.3-1.6 → 0.17, z_max 6 → 20 m).
2. truncate_at_evidence_break — walks the refined inner-chain points near
   to far, direction-aware (paint lies OUTWARD of the inner edge), and cuts
   the chain at the first _TRUNC_MIN_RUN consecutive failures: beyond a
   sustained evidence break (the crest occlusion boundary) nothing the
   chain caught is trustworthy. Contaminated crest tails fail 18-42 points
   in a row while normal frames show at most 1 isolated failure, so the
   run-length rule separates them cleanly (mode A frames 147-243:
   MAE 2.4-9.8 → < 0.8, dy_far back inside ±3 px).
