"""
Inference pipeline with a learned 2D lane detector front end (WWH-25).

A separate entry point, NOT a mode of pipeline.infer_one: the ELSED pipeline is
left untouched so the two front ends can be compared on the same frames.
Stages 1-3 of the ELSED pipeline (road mask, ELSED, tracker) are replaced; the
metric stage is the same code, called the same way.

    1. Read + resize           same PIL bilinear resize as predict_road, no PIDNet
    2. Lane detector           CLRNet (lane_detector.py): whole lane instances
    3. Ego pair                model_lane_fitting.pick_ego, as near as possible,
                               checked by guard_ego (near-field width plausible)
    4. Per-row curves          detector position at every row; each row flagged
                               paint / model by the image (optionally snapped to
                               the paint centre - off by default, see `refine`);
                               optional tail rule and depth cut; lane_fitting's
                               depth-jump guard
    5. Pitch estimation        unchanged: NearfieldWidthCalibrator →
                               resolve_lane_width → estimate_pitch_from_curves

The width is now centre-to-centre (see model_lane_fitting). The near-field
calibrator measures it per frame, so nothing downstream needs to know — except
`last_resort_lane_width`, whose 3.25 is inner-edge-to-inner-edge; pass the
centre-to-centre value for this front end.

Extra outputs, for the WWH-25 step-3 evaluation (reported, not used as gates):
    width_paint_frac      share of the pitch stage's width samples whose row is
                          paint on BOTH sides
    nearfield_paint_frac  same, over the near-field window rows

    detector
        lane_detector.CLRNet instance.
    cut_frac
        Share of the image top cropped before the detector, as it was trained
        (CULane: 270/590). Step 1 measured that running uncropped LOSES lines
        (86 % -> 66.5 % on OpenLane updown_straight), so keep the training value.
    tail
        "keep" or "last_paint" — see model_lane_fitting.apply_tail.
    refine
        "none" (default: detector positions everywhere; the paint flags are
        still computed) or "center" (snap paint rows to the stripe centre).
        WWH-25 step 3: snapping made pitch WORSE at every depth (Town05 5-10 m
        0.262° vs 0.133°) - the reference point jumps between the snapped and
        the detector centre at every dash end.
    nearfield_source
        "paint" (default: the calibrator sees only paint rows, bridged between
        paint rows as lane_curve would; no paint in the window ⇒ not measured
        this frame, the sequence holds) or "all" (the full curves). Step 3:
        model-only near fields measured widths off by up to 0.7 m; paint-only
        cut the OpenLane width error p90 from 0.59 m to 0.23 m.
    ego_guard
        Run model_lane_fitting.guard_ego on the picked pair.
    max_depth_m
        No pitch output beyond this depth (m); the estimate is made on the full
        curves and only its output is trimmed (trim_pitch_to_depth). None: no
        limit. The config sets it from the measured flattening of the weights.

    Everything else as pipeline.infer_one, and the same result keys, plus
    width_paint_frac / nearfield_paint_frac (module docstring).
