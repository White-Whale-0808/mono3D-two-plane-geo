# The old fixed z ∈ [2, 5] m is a property of this project's 1.08 m camera: on
# OpenLane's 2.116 m / 828 px camera the image bottom row already looks 6.85 m
# ahead, so that window contains ZERO rows and the whole self-calibration
# silently never ran. What actually sets the geometry is f_y·h:
#
#     z(y) = f_y·h / (y − cy)      bottom row  ->  z_bottom = f_y·h / (H/2)
#
# Lower bound: start a little past the bottom row (hood, lens edge, the rows
# where the curves are least reliable).
# Upper bound, two constraints, take the nearer:
#   curvature — the anchor assumes the road ahead IS the wheel plane; a vertical
#               curve of radius R deviates z²/(2R), i.e. a relative depth error
#               z²/(2·R·h), so z_hi <= sqrt(2·R·h·tol). Note the h in the
#               denominator: a HIGHER camera tolerates a deeper window.
#   sampling  — the window holds f_y·h·(1/z_lo − 1/z_hi) image rows; the
#               Theil-Sen intercept needs a decent number of them.
# When the two do not intersect (OpenLane: curvature says 5.63 m but the window
# cannot start before 8.22 m) sampling wins and `curvature_ok` comes back False
# — that camera's near-field anchor carries ~1.6% of curvature bias no matter
# how the parameters are chosen. That is a property of the mount, not a bug.

    The near road is the plane the wheels sit on, and the camera is rigid on
    the vehicle, so in the camera frame that plane is at Y = -camera_height by
    construction — no flatness assumption about the road ahead. That gives a

        z_h = f_y·h / (y - cy)                     (ground-plane inverse perspective)

    A Theil-Sen fit of w_real(y) against z_h separates the two calibration
    unknowns, because their error signatures differ: a wrong w_real shifts all
    rows equally, while an uncalibrated camera mounting pitch θ0 (positive =
    pitched down) scales z_h by (1 + θ0·z/h), a trend ∝ z. Hence the intercept
    at z=0 is the θ0-free width and the slope reads the mounting pitch:

                     bias is a whole-section offset rather than noise.

    The quadratic intercept absorbs road curvature as well as θ0 and wins on
    CARLA, but its extrapolation to z=0 is unstable when the window starts far
    out (z_lo/span 1.37 on CARLA vs 4.46 on OpenLane). One estimator for both
    cameras was the explicit call, so the linear intercept it is.

    Input `widths` is the usual (y_pixel, pixel_width) array. The pipeline

    One instance per CONTINUOUS image sequence: the instance is what defines
